<td>GiveCampus (YC S15) helping schools raise money more efficiently</td>
<td>GiveCampus is a Y Combinator-backed company that builds fundraising software for educational institutions. We&#x27;re working to bring actual innovation to the space, and solve the hair-on-fire problems fundraisers face. We&#x27;re tired of schools being stuck with crappy software that never changes.<p>We&#x27;re growing at an awesome pace, and now need more motivated engineers to help us build out the features and products schools want! Michael Seibel, CEO of YC, expects us to be a household name in the next few years: . We were also covered by the Washington Post last year (), and we have grown the number of schools using us by more than 5x since the article was published.<p>We&#x27;re still a small team, so if you&#x27;re looking to join a fast-growing startup and have an immediate impact, we&#x27;re looking for both full-stack (Ruby on Rails, Postgres) and front-end engineers with at least 2 years of professional experience. Our current team was previously with Facebook, Amazon, and Intel.<p>Please no recruiters or dev shops.<p>Reach out to careers@givecampus.com with a bit about why you&#x27;re passionate about education, and a project you&#x27;ve working on that you&#x27;re particularly proud of.  We&#x27;re based in DC with an office in SF, so we&#x27;re looking to hire in both locations.</td>
